      <p>
        I am Ariel and I am an Artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for art began when I was 4 years old, while I was still in preschool. This fascination with art was influenced by my sister and my cousin: my sister taught me the basics of drawing, while my cousin showed me animated series like Dragon Ball, Naruto, Digimon, Pokémon, etc. Since I was a child, I loved drawing. I remember that one of the first things I ever created, inspired by random things I watched on YouTube back then, was a comic titled "Goku vs Mario." I don’t know why I liked the idea; it was all badly drawn and poorly organized, but my 5 year old self was delighted with that piece of art I had created.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even though I’ve always loved drawing, it wasn’t until 2021 that I became serious about learning to draw as a profession and not just as a hobby. I committed myself to pursuing this seriously and to the possibility of making a living from art. Around that time, I also decided to explore other platforms and forms of art, such as digital art and 3D art. This year, in addition to continuing to improve my traditional pencil drawings, I have also been advancing in digital art and am currently more focused on 3D art, as I have finally been able to use the free 3D software called Blender, and I would like to learn more about it. I also have experience creating independent animations, mainly animations involving action, such as fight scenes, as well as comedic scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to say something to motivate people not to be afraid of art, I wouldn’t know exactly what to say — I’m not very good with words — but I would encourage them to try entering the world of art, because if they give it a shot, at least they will have a chance to succeed.
